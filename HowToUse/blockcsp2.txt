How to Use This

Host this single HTML file anywhere accessible (e.g., local test server or Catchpoint Synthetic Page Server).

In your Transaction Test:

Set a step to open:

/CSPTest.html?mode=root → Simulates Root URL CSP violation

/CSPTest.html?mode=redirect → Simulates Redirect-based root CSP violation

/CSPTest.html?mode=child → Simulates Child resource CSP violation

Watch test logs and Catchpoint records for Error 51029 (CSP violation).

Confirm whether the test continues or stops after the failing step — that will validate the bug.
